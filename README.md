```
DB_NAME='your_database_name'
DB_USER='your_mysql_username'

```

Once your '.env' has been created with the corresponding data, open up the schema ('db/schema.sql') and update the database label to match with the database you included in your '.env' file.

```
mysql -u root -p
```

After entering your password followed the following command:

```
source db/schema.sql
